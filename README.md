# methylEZ
"A user-friendly GUI to streamline the preparation of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WBGS) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) workflows. Its hybrid approach consist of generating command-line templates that can be either used directly or modified by the users at their convenience."

methylEZ bundles Picard Tools (MIT License), developed by the Broad Institute.

## Installation Instructions (Linux, macOS, Windows)
## Recommended: Use a Virtual Environment

To avoid dependency conflicts, create and activate a virtual environment before installing methylEZ:

Open your terminal (or PowerShell on Windows):

1.Install the package directly from GitHub (requires git): 
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate
pip install git+https://github.com/AlejRSosa/methylEZ
```

2.Launch the application:
```powershell
methylEZ
```

## Dependencies
methylEZ bundles Picard.jar (MIT licensed). You do not need to download Picard separately. Picard Tools requires a Java version. Please follow the instructions in Picard Tools documentation to ensure that you have the right version:

https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ 

Other dependencies are also bundled (pandas, pyperclip, ttkthemes, biopython and click).
Tkinter is required and should be installed upon download, but if you get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'`, install it manually:

ðŸ”¹ On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install python3-tk

ðŸ”¹ On Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

ðŸ”¹ On Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S tk

ðŸ”¹ On Windows/macOS: Reinstall Python with the "tcl/tk" option enabled.


## Summary:
- Always activate your .venv before running or installing methylEZ.
- This keeps all dependencies isolated and avoids downgrading/upgrading packages globally.
